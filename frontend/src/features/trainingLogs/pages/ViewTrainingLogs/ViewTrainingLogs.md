# ViewTrainingLogs Functionality

## Overview
The `ViewTrainingLogs` functionality allows users to view their training logs.

## Features
- [ ] Display training sessions by week

## Considerations
- Functionality: allow user to group Training sessions by session perform in certain week.
- Functionality: allow user to group Training sessions by session tag (Training A, Training B, etc).
- Functionality: Display header above each row informing what following row contains, for example training week (begin - end), Training sessions (Tag: Training Session A, B, etc)

## Ideas and Brainstorming
- Implement a calendar view to allow users to see their training sessions in a monthly calendar format.
- Add filtering options to allow users to filter sessions by type, date, or duration.
- Integrate with a third-party API to fetch additional data for training sessions.

## Informal Considerations and Inner Dialogue
- **How to display Training Sessions?**
  - _Solution one_
    - Simplest solution is to render each training session based on id or date order in rows containing training sessions from a certain week.
    - When a week contains 3 training sessions (Training A, Training B, and Training C), the row will be split into 3 columns.
    - Its very imperfect solution, capable to displaying data incorrectly,
    - e.g if training week should contains 2 Training Sessions, but in one week user add only one Session A and next week will start from Session A the two 'Training A' will be displayed in one row.
  - _Solution two_
    - Group Training Sessions by weeks.
    - For example one week has two sessions A and B, row will be split to two columns.
    - Each row would contains certain training week
    - Training Sessions would be grouped by weeks (week 42: [Training A, Training B])

## Implementation Details
### Display Training Sessions by Week
1. Fetch training sessions from the API.
2. Sort sessions by date.
3. Group sessions by week.
4. Render sessions in a grid layout.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge: Handling Large Data Sets
- Solution: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to load data in chunks.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a search feature to allow users to search for specific training sessions.
- Implement user authentication to allow users to save and retrieve their training logs.
